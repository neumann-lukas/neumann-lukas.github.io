## Ratings
First of all we're gonna have a look at the average ratings across various genres. Here I'm using Movies published after 2000 with more then 2000 Votes to get a representative snapshot of the current situation.

**Takeaways:**

- There are a lot of good and very few bad documentaries
- The stereotype of the bad horror/sci-fi movies also appears to be true with horror ranking last just below sci-fi

## Runtime
Next I'll have a closer look at the runtime of our favourite genres. This time I used all the movies published since 1940 across multiple interesting genres.

**Takeaways:**

- Most movies still average around the classic 90-minute mark
- Action movies often go on for longer while documentaries often last for ~50 to ~90 minutes

## Popularity over Time
But how exactly has the movie landscape changed since the 1940s especially regarding genres? Here I'll explore the popularity of certain genres over time.

*Note: The percentages may add up to more then 100% since some movies are labeled as more then one genre.*

![Result:](/assets/img/2023-01-29_imdb_year_pop.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Takeaways:**
- As expected crime movies dominated Hollywood until the 70s with almost every second movies being one
- Since 2000 Documentaries became really popular, almost reaching 40% market share
- Action Movies became especially popular in the 80s with shows like Terminator or Top Gun
- Fantasy movies are slowly dying despite being responsible for many huge (event recent) successes (Avatar, Harry Potter, LoTR)
