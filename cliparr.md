---

This is a clipboard array in python, that I programed because I didnt find any othe tool that satisfied me.
Features & Uses:
  * Have multiple clipboards that are accessible through customizable hotkeys.
  * Speed up your work by having multiple templates ready.

**Manual usage:**
  1) Download the main.py, clipboard_handeler.py and the config file or extract a manual release.
  2) Run the main.py with the folllowing command: `python main.py -c config.json`
  
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/neumann-lukas/cliparr-py)
