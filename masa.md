---

A minecraft mod created using [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge)

**The mod is in a very early stage where only the base is done.**  
**The project is currently frozen, as I want to wait for Minecraft 1.17 part 2, because there will be major technical changes!**

Planned features:
  * Extensive space exploration system
  * "Real" orbit physics
  * and lots more...  
  
The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/MASA-Mod/MASA-Mod).
